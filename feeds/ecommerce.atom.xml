Amazon South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using Takealot for online shopping for as long
as I can remember, but Amazon recently launched in South Africa
to give Takealot some competition.  I have making been many online
purchases on both since Black Friday 2024, and have decided to
share a comparison between Takealot and Amazon South Africa
based on my personal experience of shopping from the two
of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="takealot"&gt;Takealot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pros"&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items hardly ever arrive damaged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User can immediately see the prices of items when browsing
   through the various deals pages without having to click
   through to the product page of each item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The website and mobile app are both user-friendly
   and easy to navigate, and have modern UI and UX.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is simple to reschedule a delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small items are always placed into boxes to prevent them
   from being damaged by the couriers, only large items
   that already have their own sturdy packaging are not
   placed into boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The packaging tape on the boxes is very easy to remove.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cons"&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices are often much higher than Amazon South Africa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only a single collection point in my area which is inconvenient
   and out of my way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returns can be scheduled before an item is even delivered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collections for returns cannot be rescheduled by the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notifications for wish list items seem to be based on price
   changes, regardless of whether the price increases or decreases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An order cannot be cancelled once the user has paid for it,
   you have to wait for it to be delivered and then schedule
   a return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No progress bar to show the percentage of deals claimed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive use of boxes by either using oversized boxes or
   placing each order item into separate boxes instead of
   packaging everything together into a single box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="amazon-south-africa"&gt;Amazon South Africa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pros_1"&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices are often much lower than Takealot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collection points use Pudo Lockers (powered by The Courier
   Guy), and there are many around me, which makes collections
   much more convenient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order items can be cancelled before the order is packed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deals page has a progress bar that shows the percentage
   of deals claimed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cons_1"&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around 50% of the items that I ordered arrived with
   broken or damaged boxes, or even boxes that had been opened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some items are packed into soft courier bags instead of
   boxes, which causes items to be damaged by the couriers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices are not visible when browsing through the deals
   pages.  The user has to click though to the product page
   for each item to view the price of that specific item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The navigation on both the website and mobile app are very
   buggy and they both jump and make the user lose track of
   where they were while trying to scroll through the 
   deals pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UI of the page to cancel order items is hideous,
   and only allows the user to cancel the entire quantity
   instead of allowing the user to specify the quantity that
   they want to cancel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general UI and UX are very dated and not user-friendly
   at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user has to fight with the packaging tape to remove it
   from the boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
